# üì¢ Multichannel Notification System for Industrial Machines  

This repository contains the development and implementation of the **Multichannel Notification System**, created during a thesis project at **ADIGE-SYS**, part of the **BLM Group**, a global leader in the production and digitalization of laser systems for large-scale sheet metal and tube processing.

## üìñ Project Overview  

With the rapid evolution of technology and communication, the **Multichannel Notification System** was designed to modernize how industrial machines communicate their status to customers.  
The system leverages popular messaging platforms like **Telegram**, **Teams**, **Slack**, and **WhatsApp**, replacing the traditional email-based notifications used by ADIGE-SYS.  

### üöÄ Why This Project?  
The previous email-based notification system (using the **Ewon** industrial VPN router) had several limitations:  
- Lack of real-time interactivity.  
- Inefficient handling of instant notifications.  
- Limited integration with modern communication platforms.  
- Security concerns regarding sensitive data transmitted via email.  

The new system addresses these challenges by delivering **real-time, encrypted notifications** through messaging apps, ensuring a more secure and interactive communication channel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Phases  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Definition & Solution Design**  
- Collaborated with company stakeholders to analyze the need for a modern notification system.  
- Defined objectives to make communications faster and more accessible using messaging platforms customers already utilize daily.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ System Architecture Design**  
- Designed a **modular and scalable microservices-based architecture** to ensure extensibility.  
- Technologies used:  
  - **.NET 6** for API server development.  
  - **gRPC** for efficient, high-performance inter-service communication.  
  - **SQLite** for data management.  
  - **Docker** for containerization of the application.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation**  
- Developed using **gRPC**, leveraging **HTTP/2** and **Protocol Buffers** for API definition, ensuring cross-language compatibility, scalability, and efficiency.  
- Conducted a demonstration test on the **LS7 laser machine**, using **Telegram** as the primary communication channel.  
- Confirmed the system‚Äôs ability to:  
  - Register users securely.  
  - Send real-time notifications.
